                          I’m a web developer who mostly focuses on Front End Development. I spend most of my day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming; and dabbling with PHP and Ruby. I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the programming world so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. But wait, there's more! I also like a good turkey salad, green juicing, and reading(non-fiction).</p>
